https://www.myfitnesspal.com/,completed,9/10,"MyFitnessPal relies on Bedrock/Claude and third‑party SDKs—Inference.net trains private, domain‑tuned models to replace costly LLM calls for Voice Log, AI Meal Planner, smarter search, and data QA, delivering 2–3x faster inference at up to 90% lower cost. We align with your privacy and on‑device goals by deploying compact speech/NLP and vision models that keep health data off third parties. Our Schematron HTML→JSON engine also upgrades Recipe Import and receipt/label parsing to auto‑structure nutrition data and boost food DB quality.","MyFitnessPal is actively integrating artificial intelligence across its platform to enhance user experience and provide more personalized nutritional guidance. The company's AI strategy focuses on simplifying food logging and offering intelligent meal planning. Key AI-powered features include 'MealScan,' which uses computer vision technology from partner Passio AI to identify foods from photos; 'Voice Log,' which leverages natural language processing with foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to log meals by speaking; and a new AI-driven 'Meal Planner,' developed following the acquisition of the startup Intent. This strategic push, highlighted in their Winter 2025 update, aims to transform the app from a manual tracking tool into a proactive and intelligent nutrition assistant. The use of third-party LLMs, including Anthropic Claude via AWS Bedrock for prototyping, is confirmed, indicating a flexible approach to implementing AI solutions to drive user engagement and support their premium subscription model.",2025-09-29T22:27:44.530Z,2025-09-29T22:58:40.738Z
https://www.calai.app/,completed,9/10,"You’re running a high-volume photo-to-nutrition pipeline where accuracy and latency directly drive retention and margins—Inference.net can train a custom vision-language model on your food and packaging data to boost precision and cut response times. Our models run 2–3x faster and up to 90% cheaper than OpenAI/Anthropic, and can emit schema-validated JSON (macros, ingredients, allergens) to slash manual corrections. You’ll get a private, fully owned model deployable in your VPC, turning millions of inferences into substantial monthly savings while improving user experience.",,2025-09-29T22:25:54.341Z,2025-09-29T22:58:08.489Z
