### Tasks Completed âœ…
1. **Fixed OpenAI temperature error**
   - Removed `temperature: 0.3` parameter from openai-analyzer.ts
   - GPT-5 only supports the default temperature value of 1
   - File: `src/lib/openai-analyzer.ts`

2. **Migrated to Modern DataGrid with Sidebar**

   - All columns have min/max size constraints to prevent over-expansion
   - Better visual feedback on resize handles (blue highlight on hover/drag)
   - Tooltips on truncated content (hover to see full text)
   - Actions column is non-resizable (fixed width)
   - Fixed table layout with `table-layout: fixed` for proper width control
